# Findzo

#### The concept of Findzo came to me in my college days. I wanted to do something with keeping a track of stuff I forget. This solves that issue. Findzo is an IoT concept which uses the help of nodemcu to track the important things while the application uses bluetooth to remain connected to the device, so whenever we go out of the range of the device, the device will ring and applpication will send me a notification.

###### This application was made sometime back when I was learning android development. The code is depreciated now, however I still wanted to upload this to Github, maybe someone will collaborate to update this. I have already started working on a new application which can replace this but this code will remain here, to look and to collaborate in the spirit of open source. This is an android only application.
